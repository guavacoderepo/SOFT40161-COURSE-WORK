## Overview

In this coursework, I analyze mental health cases among employees from various organizations or companies using a free Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains 27 columns, from which 11 were selected for analysis. These columns provide key information on the employees’ mental health status and support.

- Age, Country, and Gender: Provides demographic details such as age, region, and gender.
- Self_employed: Indicates whether the respondent is self-employed or working for an organization.
- Family_history: Shows if there is a history of mental health issues in the respondent’s family.
- Treatment: Indicates whether the respondent is receiving treatment for mental health.
- No_employees: Specifies the number of employees in the respondent’s company.
- Wellness_program: Tells if the company offers well-being programs for employees.
- Leave: Indicates whether the company provides leave for employees.
- Care_options: Shows if the company offers care options to their staff.
- Obs_consequence: Describes whether the respondent has mental health challenges or not.

This data helps explore the relationship between various factors and employee mental health in different work environments.

From the analysis, it can be seen that:

- Most mental health cases by region are reported from North America.
- By gender, mental health issues appear to be more common among men.
- The majority of respondents do not have a history of mental health issues in their families.
- Most respondents to the survey are men, indicating a potential gender bias in the data or a higher level of participation from male employees.
